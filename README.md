Modeling kinases relevant for fibrosis development in various diseases

Biological Relevance

DDR1 plays a role in extracellular matrix turnover. Connection with oxidative stress and extracellular matrix crosslinking. In other words it is connected to fibrosis development. Potentially a biomarker, thus therapeutic approach is to find DDR1 inhibitors. May play a role in Collgen deposition in various tissues such as liver and kidneys.

MAPK14 plays a role in extracellular matrix remodeling in the connection with various pathways such as TGFB signaling, immune activation and inflammation cytokine signaling. Altogether these mechanisms can orchestrate fibroblast differentiation
